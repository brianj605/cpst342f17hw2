Author: Brian Johnson (bjohnson12)

(Extra Credit: 5 pts) Correctly import and use 1 or 2 Google Font(s).
(Extra Credit: 5 pts) Use a font-stack.
(Extra Credit: 20 pts) Write your CSS using SCSS instead. Be sure to compile to CSS and include all files in your repository.
(Extra Credit: 10 pts) Use fully-semantic HTML


Building own grid:
Based on the example on Sakai this was an easy task to do.  I found it to be straight forward.
To reduce the amount of CSS I had to write I used SCSS to generate the column percentages.
I haven't used SCSS before, so it was interesting to play around with some.

Bootstrap grid:
I generally don't do layout work in my job since I am a backend developer, so I don't have experience with grids with bootstrap.
I found getting the correct files/folders out of the Bootstrap download zip file to be a little confusing, when also taking a look at what
JavaScript files might be used with it in a future week's homework.  The examples were easy to adapt.  I needed to come up
with some additional content to put in in the grid to vary the "colspan" so I used photos that I have taken.  I did like that
Bootstrap has some responsive design aspects built in, so it was interesting playing around with those.  Originally I didn't put my
rows in a container class so the width of the page was overflowing.  If I had some experience with bootstrap I probably wouldn't
have made that mistake, which was a waste of some time.

Compare/contrast:
I think if I were to do a project I might use bootstrap, especially if I was going to work on it with a group of people and 
everyone was familiar with it, but I did like the aspect of making my own grid in that I knew what all the styles (like padding) was in it.
